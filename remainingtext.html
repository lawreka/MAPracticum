      These sticker sheets for users to cut out and affix eyes to their devices play with differing degrees of realism and brand identity integration. The first, cartoonish eyes, are the most universal and relatable, based on cartoon characters. The second set of eyes are slightly more realistic but also incorporate the colors of the smart speaker's parent company, as a visual reminder of who is really listening. The third set of eyes are intended to be as realistic as possible, so they use normal human eye colors.

      Involving the user in cutting out and placing the eye stickers as part of the DIY aspect of these critical designs also ensures that they are personally invested in the design and this participatory action will also make the design more effective.

      Since most users do not have access to 3-D printing devices, this design solution is the most future-facing but it is also the most straightforward. Smart speakers are not really looking devices, they are hearing devices. By 3-D printing replicas of human ears and affixing them to the devices, the nature of the device as always listening is explicitly expressed in the design.
