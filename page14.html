         Initial reactions to these DIY critical design interventions have been mixed. Some observers found them a smart way to literalize the implications of constant surveillance through altering the product design and were unbothered by the disembodied parts stuck to the devices. Several likened them to <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brands/playskool/mrpotatohead" target="_blank">Mr. Potato Head</a> toys, an unthreatening memory from childhood. Others found the images uncomfortable. This is exactly the point: introducing discomfort or uncanniness to these objects changes our relationship with the ubiquitous conversational agents that are invited into our homes.

         Further research would involve users choosing to alter the devices they use in their homes via these design interventions and observing them to see whether their patterns of use or self-reported attitudes towards the smart speakers changed over time.
